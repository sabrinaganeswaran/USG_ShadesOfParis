    <h1><strong> What you must DO !</strong></h1>
      <p>Depending where on these rain-soaked isles you call home, this weekend may well be your last taste of toasty sunshine until 2013.</p>

      <p>And if you’ll be dusting off your sunnies for one final time, remember these essential rules…</p>

      <p>01. Indoors or at night?<p>
      <p>If you’re not wearing your shades alfresco, you’ve probably got about a 30-second window before everyone thinks you’re a complete tool. So, no.<p>

      <p>02. Size matters<p>
      <p>Big glasses are proper glam, but strike a balance between your style and what you can pull off.<p>

      <p>03. Perv check<p>
      <p>Covertly checking the ladies out is one of the great joys of summer. But double-check the opacity of your eyewear beforehand.<p>

      <p>04. Round face<p>
      <p>North Korean moon-face Kim Jong-il was an expert at matching sunnies with face-shape, donning square frames to angulate his pudgy features.<p>

      <p>05. Mirrored lenses<p>
      <p>It’s proper disconcerting talking to someone in mirrored specs only to see your own mug staring back at you.<p>

      <p>06. Match glasses and garms<p>
      <p>Match the colour of your frames with your shoes; keep it subtle and you’ll look the money.<p>

      <p>07. On top of your head?<p>
      <p>A proper opinion divider. If you’re wearing them as some sort of weird, posy UV protecting tiara, then no. If it’s because you don’t own pockets, yes.<p>

      <p>08. Upside down?<p>
      <p>Don’t ever wear your glasses upside down, you’ll look like snooker player Dennis Taylor.<p>

      <p>09. On trend<p>
      <p>Retro, as opposed to the techy ’90s styles, are this summer’s main attraction. Tortoiseshell is a winner as are smaller frames.<p>

      <p>10. Save your sunnies<p>
      <p>Invest in a good pair of shades and don’t ditch ’em. You’re pretty much guaranteed that the style will come around every 10 years or so, so it’s good to play the long game.</p>

    <h1><strong> What you must'nt DO !</strong></h1>
      <p>Few fashion accessories are as polarizing as sunglasses, with styles ranging from classic tortoiseshell frames to outlandish shapes and tints. But more than the size and shape, it’s when sunglasses are worn that generates the most cheers and jeers as people navigate the unwritten rules of when to stow their shades.</p>

      <p>Here's a cheat sheet for proper etiquette in a variety of situations and environments so you're not caught out when the sun shines.<p>

      <strong>When you meet someone…</strong>

      <p>Unless you’re an on-duty Secret Service Agent, lose the blacked out lenses when you’re making someone’s acquaintance. Eye contact is a courtesy and a key component of non-verbal communication, so make a good first impression and squint for a minute or two while you make introductions. For good measure, try not to hold too many conversations – even with people you already know - with shades hiding your lying eyes.<p>

      <strong>At night…</strong>

      <p>No. Not even if you’re Corey Hart.</P>

      <strong>At work…</strong>

      <p>Use good sense here, if you work in a recording studio and spend afternoons comparing aviators with Lenny Kravitz, then by all means, go ahead. But for the American Office Worker, it’s as simple as this: Take them off when you hit the door. It’s also a good idea to slip sunglasses in a case or pocket for the day – no head-perching – and keep them tidy; smudgy lenses are a sign of someone spending too much time with the break room donuts. Channel your inner Don Draper and keep the style classic, no bright pink frames or full aero blades at the office, they’re a distraction.</p>

      <strong>Indoors…</strong>

      <p>Comedian Larry David makes no bones about wearing dark glasses with a roof overhead. “You know who wears sunglasses inside?” he asks. “Blind people and….” Well, let’s just say you don’t want to be in the other category. Short of being visually impaired or traveling directly from an optometrist appointment with dilated eyes (and seriously, have a friend pick you up), there’s no reason to wear sunglasses inside. If there is a single style rule the whole world can agree on, it’s to shed the shades when you pass through a doorway. The generally accepted rule is that you’ve got five seconds to lose the glasses before people start to point and whisper.</p>

      <strong>Sports…</strong>

      <p>Plenty of sports demand eye protection and glare-cutting sunglasses can be just the thing. But athletes can get pigeonholed by the media (or their adult league softball teammates) for curiously styled and always-on eyewear. Golfer David Duval was called a “mystery behind welding glasses” for his omnipresent shades and the 2013 Tour de France was “disrespected” by a pair of sunnies fit for Elvis himself. Choose wisely, and remember to take them off when the cameras come by for post-game interviews.</p>

      <strong>In photographs…</strong>

      <p>Say cheese, and take off those ridiculous glasses. Unless the subject of the photo is a dog – dogs wearing sunglasses are adorable – ditch the shades when it’s time for a selfie. If you must feature your favorite pair of lenses in your portrait, try using them as a filter for the camera itself.</p>
